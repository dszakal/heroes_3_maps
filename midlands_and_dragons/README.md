# Midlands and Dragons

A mostly fair advanced 8/8 Map for multiplayer. When it starts it seems easy, but excitement is arriving and growing with progress. When one gets the town in the middle (Midlands), all players need to fight with everything to get it and keep it. When the gates to the players are unlocked, everything becomes possible. Relics can be found, but fighting for them is extremely costy.

As Midlands is a Conflux town, you cannot choose Conflux on the map. That would be cheating. This way the map is trying to be balanced between the 8 free for all players.
